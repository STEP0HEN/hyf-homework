Egg Stew recipe

Ingredients
1 big mackerel cleaned, gutted and cut to steak
1 chopped tomatoes, substitute with 4-6 fresh tomatoes
red bell peppe sliced. optional
11/2 onion chopped
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 large eggs
cayenne pepper use according to preference
salt to taste
Bullion cube I used Knorr cube
1 tsp Curry
1 tsp Thyme
1 tsp parsley optional
Instructions
Add salt, seasoning, curry, thyme, half of the chopped onions to mackerel steak and bring to boil for 5-7 minutes. Take fish off the heat, allow to cool, remove the bones and flake into chunks.
Place a pan on medium heat, add vegetable oil, heat for about 3 minutes and add the rest of the chopped onion, curry and thyme and stir fry till onion become translucent. 
Follow by chopped tomatoes and bring to boil for another 4-5 minutes. Add salt and seasoning, sliced red pepper. Stir cayenne pepper into the sauce and continue to cook till oil begins to float atop the sauce. (This should take about 5 to 10 minutes)
Add flaked fish to sauce and stir gently to avoid scattering the fish further.
Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk till well combined. (you can add salt if you want) Add whisked eggs into the fish stew making sure it is covering the whole sauce. Allow egg to set before stirring, this should take about 2 minutes. Once the egg is set, stir so as to allow the uncooked part of the egg to cook. Take egg stew off heat so as not to overcook and dry out.
Serve with side of choice. This kind of egg stew is very popular with boiled yam, Agege bread and rice.
